      <h1>How to Choose a Good Budgie?</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>Purchasing a budgie is a big commitment because they live so long, you really need to make sure you are buying the right bird for you and your family.
          In order to find a good budgie, you need to assess the bird's health, personality, and happiness before your purchase.
           Finding a budgie that will be a long-term happy member of your family takes some diligence on your part,
            as well as a willingness to walk away from a bird that's just not right for you.</p>
   <br>
      <h1>Part 1: Choosing a Healthy Budgie</h1>
      <br/>
      <img src="imags/budgie 0.jpg" alt="OOPS!">
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>1."Locate budgies for sale from a reputable seller"</h3>
        <p>You can find budgies for sale online, in want-ads, or in pet stores.
         You can also get one from your local animal shelter.
         Wherever you get your budgie from, make sure the seller has healthy and humanely treated birds.</p>
         <br/>
         <ul>
            <li>Look at online reviews for the sellers you find. Are most buyers satisfied with the birds that they purchased from the seller?
            </li>
            <li>If you have a friend that has budgies, ask them where you can get good birds. This is especially helpful if they got their bird, or birds, recently.</li>

         </ul>
         <br>
            <h3>2."Visit a store or an individual seller"</h3>
             <p>Assess how they make you feel.
             Does the space feel clean and well cared for?
             Do you think the people working at the store 
             or the person selling the birds feels responsible and invested in the health and happiness of the birds?
              If any of this feels wrong, walk away and look for another place</p>

            <br>
               <h3>3."Ask the seller how they care for their birds"</h3>
                <p>It is important they look after the birds well in order for them to be healthy and happy.
                 Make sure they are cleaning the birds cages regularly.
                 Are the sellers cleaning their hands before handling the birds?
                  These are simple but important things that keep budgies healthy and happy</p>
             <br>
                  <h3>4."Examine the cage the budgies are in"</h3>
                     <p> Budgies need a clean and spacious cage.
                      Are there so many budgies in there they can't all move?
                      Is the cage or bin dirty?
                      Does the condition of the cage line up with what the seller told you they do to care for their birds?
                      Do the birds have water?
                       Do the birds have appropriate food, such as seed, pellets, and vegetables?
                       These are all important things to assess before moving forward with purchasing a budgie</p>
                  <br>
                     
                        <h3>5."Consider whether the birds look healthy and happy"</h3>
                         <p>Are the birds interacting with one another? 
                         Look at the head, body, and legs of each bird you are considering. 
                         If it is healthy and happy its feathers should be smooth and shiny, not all puffed up. 
                         It should have a healthy appetite, so you should see it eating seed. 
                         Its beak and feet should not be crusted. 
                         Its vents should be clear and it should not have any nasal discharge. 
                         The budgie feathers should be clean</p>
                         <br/>
                         <ul>
                           <li>The feathers should have an appearance that is shiny, sleek, and smooth.</li>
                           <li>The budgies should not have any growths or abnormalities.</li>
                           <li>The budgies' feet should be clear of mites and its toes should be clean and smooth.</li>
                         </ul>
   
   <br>
      <h1>Part 2:Choosing a Budgie for Personality and Appearance</h1>
      <img src="imags/budgie div3.jpg" alt="OOPS!">
      <br/>
      <br/>
      
         <h3>1."Assess your potential budgie's temperament"</h3>
          <p>If it is healthy and happy then it should be active and seem happy.
           Does it move around, eat seed, and drink water?
           While a budgie should be relatively calm when left alone, it is natural for a budgie to tighten its feathers when you come near its cage, so don't read that behavior negatively</p>
      <br/>
           <ul>
         <li>Usually, the budgies from pet shops are not hand tamed, which means that you will have to be willing to take the time to help it get accustomed to your hand, if you want to be able to hold it. If you want to buy a budgie that is already hand tamed, you will need to go to a specialized budgie breeder. Trained ones are a lot more expensive.
         </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
         <h3>2."Look for a budgie that is young"</h3>
          <p>You can tell the age of a budgie by the black bars on the forehead.
          A young budgie (under 4 months) will have black bars all the way down to the cere, which is the fleshy part above the beak.
           Above 4 months, the bars will disappear.</p>
           <br/>
           <ul>
            <li>If the budgie is "molting" it is around 6 months old, this is a good age to train a budgie.</li>
           </ul>
           <br>
      <h3>3."Determine if your potential budgie is male or female"</h3>
         <p>This only matters if you have a preference and only works when they are old enough that the bars are gone.
          For males, the cere is blue or purple. 
          For females, the cere will be very light blue, beige, or brown.</p>
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Male budgies are slightly better talkers, so if you are concerned with that you might want to make sure you get a male bird.
               However, a young healthy bird of either sex can be a great talker with the right training</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h3>4."Pick a bird that is attractively colored"</h3>
             <p>If you are purchasing a budgie from a seller that has a lot of healthy and active birds, then feel free to pick your budgie based on looks.
             Budgies come in a huge variety of colors, so pick the color combination that you like best!</p>

      <h1>How to Choose a Cage for a Budgie?</h1>
      <br>
      <p>With so many cages of different shapes and sizes advertised for small birds, it can be intimidating to know which cage is best for your feathery friend. While budgies may seem like small and low-maintenance pets, they still need enough room to exercise and explore, as well as a safe and secure home. Understanding the fundamentals of what makes a good cage is essential. This wikiHow article will help you choose the perfect cage for your budgie</p>
      <br>
      <h1>Part 1:Choosing the Correct Cage</h1>
      <img src="imags/budgie cage1.jpg" alt="OOPS!!">
         <br/>
         <br/>
         <h3>1."Pick a cage with enough room"</h3>
          <p>The first feature of a cage that you should consider is the size. Budgies are very active and get most of their exercise from flying.
          The minimum space requirement for one budgie is 18" x 18" x 18" and 30" x 18" x 18" for two</p>
          <br/>
          <ul>
            <li>Budgies require horizontal space to fly. Purchase a cage that is elongated side-ways, rather than one that substitutes length with height. Tall cages that are narrow aren't suitable.</li>
            <li>The more space you provide your budgie, the happier they will be.</li>
            <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Do not get trapped into buying overly small-sized bird cages from pet stores that are sold for profit rather than the health of your bird</p>
          </ul>
      <br>
            <h3>2."Look for a cage made of sturdy material"</h3>
            <p>Budgies are capable of chewing certain materials and can utilize their beak to escape. Wire, metal, or stainless steel cages offer that extra bit of security</p>
      <br>
            <ul>
               <li>Examine the cage to ensure there are no hazards or sharp edges on the wiring of the cage</li>
               <li>Avoid cages made of lead or zinc, which can be harmful to your bird.</li>
               
            </ul>
      <br>
            <h3>3."Ensure that the bars of the cage are appropriately spaced"</h3>
            <p>12mm or Â½ in is an ideal space measurement for the grids of the cage. Anything larger and your budgie will be able to get stuck between the spacing of the bars, or escape</p>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>Avoid parallel bars where your budgie might be able to slip their foot into a tight gap. The wires of the cage can run vertically or horizontally.</li>
            </ul>
      <h3>4."Purchase a cage with a secure door that locks"</h3>
      <p>Budgies are intelligent and inquisitive birds that can utilize their beaks to open the door of their cage if it isn't secure. Doors that slide up and down are not a suitable choice, as budgies can easily escape by lifting the door up.</p>
   <br>
   <h1>Part 2: Setting Up the Cage</h1>
   <img class="image6" src="imags/Rbudgie cage 2.jpg" alt="OOPS!">
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <h3>1."Place the cage in a suitable location"</h3>
      <p>Place your budgie's cage in a well-ventilated, temperature-controlled room that is out of direct sunlight. Choose a room that is secured away from small children and other household pets.</p>
      <p><strong>Warning:</strong>Do not place your budgie next to a window. If your budgie spots a predator, such as a neighborhood cat or another bird, they will become scared and feel unsafe in their home.</p>
      <br>
         <h3>2."Provide your budgie with at least one perch to sit on"</h3>
         <p>A good set-up should have multiple perches placed near the top of the cage to encourage exploring and movement.</p>
         <br>
         <ul>
            <li>At least one perch should be higher or lower than the other perches for the birds to jump up and down.</li>
            <li>Natural tree branches can be good alternatives if they are strong enough for the birds to stand on.</li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <h3>3."Place safe toys inside the cage"</h3>
         <p>Toys are essential to keep your budgie mentally stimulated, encourage enrichment and play, and to reduce boredom. Budgies like toys such as bells, ladders, swings, and mirrors.</p>
         <br>
         <ul>
            <li>Purchase some green clips to hang treats on the side of the cage, such as greens, millet, and cuttlefish.</li>
         </ul>

<div class="div3">
   <h1>How to Feed Budgies?</h1>
   <br>
    <p>Every budgie owner wants their pet to have the best life possible. A healthy diet is the best route to keeping your budgie happy and alive. A nutritionally balanced diet will make sure he gets the proper nutrients he needs every day. Improper feeding can lead to nutritional imbalances and eventually illness and, in extreme cases, death. However, if you learn to feed him properly, he will have a happy and healthy life</p>
   <h1>Choosing the Right Foods</h1>
   <img src="imags/budgie food1.jpg" alt="OOPS!">
   <br/>
   <br/>
   <h3>1."Buy pellets"</h3>
   <p> One of the staples in a budgie's diet is pellets. You can buy pellets in your local pet food store that are suitable for budgies. The pellets are the best way for your budgie to have a nutritionally balanced diet because they contain tons of nutrients for the bird.</p>
   <br>
   <ul>
      <li>When you buy the pellets, make sure they don't have any preservatives, added sugars, artificial colorings, or artificial flavors in them.</li>
      <li>Pellets are the best option for your budgie as they can't pick out the tastiest bits and leave the healthy bits behind.</li>
   
   </ul>
   <br>
   <h3>2."Use fruits and vegetables"</h3>
   <p>Use fruits and vegetables.Fruits and vegetables form a very important part of your budgie's diet. Dark green or yellow vegetables should be offered daily. Try fruits and vegetables such as apples, pumpkin, grapes, carrot, parsley, broccoli, mango, sweet potato, squash, and spinach. You can also serve millet 1 to 2 times a week.Feed the fruits and vegetables to your budgie raw, because cooking takes away vital nutrients</p>
   <br>
   <ul>
      <li>They can be served in any way the budgie prefers, which may be chopped, shredded, diced, sliced, pureed, or whole. Try multiple ways until you find the way your budgie likes best.</li>
      <li>Remove what your budgie doesn't eat after two hours, since cut, raw vegetables can go bad quickly.</li>
      <li>There are some fruits and vegetables that you should never feed your bird because they are toxic to him/her. This includes avocado, the pits and seeds of fruit (apple seeds contain cyanide and are especially toxic), chocolate, garlic, onion, mushrooms, uncooked beans, rhubarb, and the leaves and stems of tomatoes.</li>

   </ul>
   <br>
   <h3>3."Provide hard-boiled eggs and grated cheese"</h3>
   <p>Although this may sound unusual for a budgie, it adds a great source of protein for your budgie. It also adds a little variety to his diet and provides beneficial nutrients, which is always a good thing.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>4."Change the water daily"</h3>
   <p>All birds need water all day long in a clean water container. To keep clean and fresh, replace the water dish every day with a fresh dish. Clean the dish with vinegar and water only. Never use soap or chemicals to clean it. The vinegar will help prevent any bacteria from building up in the dish.</p>
   <ul>
      <li>Never put vitamins in the water because it could lead to infection or bacteria buildup, and your budgie may refuse to drink the water. The only things you should put in the water are medications, such as antibiotics, as instructed by your vet.</li>

   </ul>
</div>
<div class="div4">
<h1>How to Identify your Budgie Sex?</h1>
<br>
<p>If you just got a budgie, you may want to determine its sex. Learn which colors signify a male or female budgie. You can also watch your budgie's behavior or listen to it to determine the sex. If you're still having trouble, remember you can always consult your veterinarian or the breeder that sold you the budgie.</p>
   <image src="imags/budgie sex.jpg" alt="OOPS!">
      <br/>
      <br/>
    <h3>1."Find the budgie's cere"</h3>
   <p>The cere is a fleshy covering which is located directly above its beak.The budgie's nostrils are found on the cere (they look like two in-depth holes) making the cere easy to find. While most budgie's beaks are a yellowish color, the cere is a certain color depending on the bird's sex.</p>
   <br>
   <h3>2."Identify a male budgie"</h3>
   
    <p>Most male budgies in the breeding mood have a bright or royal blue cere.Sometimes, the vibrant color can appear purple-blue.This color will lighten when the budgie is not in the breeding mood.</p>
     <br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you've identified your budgie as male and notice his cere turn brown, he may have a medical condition.</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <h3>3."Identify a female budgie"</h3>
     <p> A female adult budgie's cere is usually white, pink or pale blue.As she becomes more fertile and ready to produce eggs, the cere will become a darker tan or brownish in color.
   </p>
     <ul>
      <li>
         If the budgie is fertile and ready to breed, you may also notice the cere thicken and become crusty.The cere build up can be about a centimeter thick.
      </li>
     </ul>

   <h1 class="title" id="FAQ">FAQ</h1>
   <h3>Q.Is it normal for a feather on the tail to stick up?</h3>
   <p>The tail feathers should lie flat in a streamlined manner.
      It's likely one of the feathers got knocked and its damaged near the base.
      However, there is no need to take any action.
      The budgie isn't in pain. Avoid trying to remove the sticking-up feather as shaft of a growing feather has a large blood supply and trying to dislodge the quill could cause hemorrhage</p>
   <br>
      <h3>Q.I want to get a budgie but can't convince my parents. I already get good school grades (so can't work harder) and have tried the basics such as I'll pay for it, I'll feed it. What else can I do?</h3>
   <p>Actions speak louder than words, so show how responsible you are by keeping your room clean and tidy. Start earning money so that you can prove to your parents how serious you are, so offer to babysit, clean cars, walk dogs that sort of thing. Also, have a chat to your parents about what it is that's making them refuse. If you can understand why they say "No," then you can do something to help ease their concern.</p>
<br>
<h3>Q.Can I keep two females?</h3>
<p>There's a greater risk of two female birds being confrontational and fighting. Getting a bird of the opposite gender is less likely to end in fights and be harmonious.</p>
